 *  The relation among CchI, SchI, GuardI, SyncI:
 *  1. they are all time durations, normally default CCH interval is 50ms,
 *  SCH interval is 50ms, Guard Interval is 4ms, SyncI is 100ms.
 *  2. Every UTC second shall be an integer number of SyncI, and the
 *  beginning of a sync interval shall align with beginning of UTC second;
 *  SyncI is sum of CchI and SchI. Channel will be in either CchI
 *  state or SchI state. If channel access is alternating, the channel
 *  shall do channel switch operation. At the beginning of each CCH interval
 *  or SCH interval is a guard interval. GuardI is sum of SyncTolerance
 *  and MaxSwitchTime.
 *  3. because some papers need to use dynamic CchI and SchI interval,
 *  so in this class, every UTC second may not be an integer number of SyncI.

 *  <---------------      Guard Interval     ---------------------->
 *
 * The relation among GuargInterval, SyncTolerance and MaxSwitchTime
 * 1.  GuardInterval = SyncTolerance/2 + MaxChSwitchTime + SyncTolerance/2
 * they are all time durations, normally default SyncTolerance is 2ms,
 * MaxChSwitchTime is 2ms, GuardInterval is 4ms.
 * 2. SyncTolerance/2 is used for synchronization that WAVE devices
 * may not be precisely aligned in time. MaxChSwitchTime represents that
 * WAVE device is in channel switch state. Although the channel switch time
 * ChannelSwitchDelay of YansWifiPhy is 250 microseconds, the channel switch
 * time of real wifi device is more than 1 milliseconds.
